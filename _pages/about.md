About Me
=====
I am a PhD student at the University of Queensland, where I work on problems in analytic number theory. I am also interested in graph theory. My supervisors are [Adrian Dudek](https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/13577/adrian-dudek) and [Darryn Bryant](https://smp.uq.edu.au/profile/209/darryn-bryant).

You can email me at s.n.thomas@student.uq.edu.au.

Here is my [CV](https://simonnthomasmaths.github.io/files/cv.pdf), last updated in June, 2025.
